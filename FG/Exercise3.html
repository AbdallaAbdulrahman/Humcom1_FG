		 THE 7 LAYERS OF THE OSI Model
		</font>
		</h2> 
		
		<section>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the OSI model, control is passed from one layer to the next, starting at the application layer (Layer 7) in one station, and proceeding to the bottom layer, over the channel to the next station and back up the hierarchy. The OSI model takes the task of inter-networking and divides that up into what is referred to as a vertical stack that consists of the following 7 layers.<br><br>

		<b> APPLICATION (LAYER 7)</b> <br> OSI Model, Layer 7, supports application and end-user processes. Communication partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user authentication and privacy are considered, and any constraints on data syntax are identified. Everything at this layer is application-specific. This layer provides application services for file transfers, e-mail, and other network software services.  <font color="red">Telnet</font>  and FTP are applications that exist entirely in the application level. Tiered application architectures are part of this layer.<br><br>

		<b>PRESENTATION (LAYER 6)</b> <br> This layer provides independence from differences in data representation (e.g., <font color="red">encryption</font>) by translating from application to network format, and vice verEncryptionsa. The presentation layer works to transform data into the form that the application layer can accept. This layer formats and encrypts data to be sent across a network, providing freedom from compatibility problems. It is sometimes called the syntax layer.<br><br>

		<b>SEASSION (LAYER 5)</b><br>  This layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between<font color="red"> applications</font> . The session layer sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogues between the applications at each end. It deals with session and connection coordination.<br><br>

		<b>TRANSPORT (LAYER 4)</b><br>  OSI Model, Layer 4, provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and <font color="red">flow control</font> . It ensures complete data transfer.<br><br>

		<b> NETWORK (LAYER 3)</b><br> Layer 3 provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths, known as  <font color="red">virtual circuits</font> , for transmitting data from node to node. Routing and forwarding are functions of this layer, as well as ,internetworking<font color="red"> addressing</font> , error handling, congestion control and packet sequencing. <br><br>

		<b>DATA LINK (LAYER 2)</b><br>  At OSI Model, Layer 2, data packets are encoded and decoded into bits. It furnishes <font color="red">transmission protocol</font> knowledge and management and handles errors in the physical layer, flow control and frame synchronization. The data link layer is divided into two sub layers: The Media Access Control (MAC) layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer. The MAC sub layer controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and permission to transmit it. The LLC layer controls frame <font color="red">synchronization</font> , flow control and error checking.<br><br>

		<b>PHYSICAL (LAYER 1)</b><br>  OSI Model, Layer 1 conveys the bit stream – electrical impulse, light or radio signal through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier, including defining cables, cards and physical aspects. Fast Ethernet,<font color="red">RS232</font> , and <font color="red">ATM</font>  are protocols with physical layer components.<br><br>

		Definition of Terms:

		</h2>

		<section><ol type = "I">
		<dl>
		 <dt><font color="red">Telnet:</font>
		 <dd><dt><font face="" color="blue"> 
       The Telnet protocol is designed to provide a bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility to allow for a a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and processes</font></dd>
		 
		 <dt><font color="red"> Encryption:</font> 
		 <dd><dt><font face="Tahoma" color="blue"> 
		Encryption is the process of translating data into a secret format so that only authorized parties can understand the information. Plain text, or readable data that is not encrypted, is converted into cipher text, or scrambled data that is unreadable. Encryption takes readable data and alters it so it appears random. This is done to protect and secure the confidentiality of data transmitted through a network.</font></dd>
		 
		 
		 <dt><font color="red">Application:</font> 
		 <dd><dt><font face="Tahoma" color="blue">
		 An application is any program, or group of programs, that is designed for the end user. Applications software (also called end-user programs) include such things as database programs, word processors, Web browsers and spreadsheets. </font></dd>
		 
        <dt><font color="red">  Flow Control:</font> 
		 <dd><dt><font face="Tahoma" color="blue">
		the process of adjusting the flow of data from one device to another to ensure that the receiving device can handle all of the incoming data. This is particularly important where the sending device is capable of sending data much faster than the receiving device can receive it. <br> There are many flow control mechanisms. One of the most common flow control protocols for asynchronous communication is called xon-xoff. In this case, the receiving device sends a an xoff message to the sending device when its buffer is full. The sending device then stops sending data. When the receiving device is ready to receive more data, it sends an xon signal.</font></dd>
		 
		  
        <dt><font color="red">  Addressing :</font> 
		 <dd><dt><font face="Tahoma" color="blue">
		 An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a TCP/IP network. Networks using the TCP/IP protocol route messages based on the IP address of the destination.</font></dd>
		
		  <dt><font color="red">  Transmission protocol:</font> 
		 <dd><dt><font face="Tahoma" color="blue">
		   (pronounced as separate letters) TCP/IP is short for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.<br> TCP/IP is the suite of communications protocols used to connect hosts on the Internet. TCP/IP uses several protocols, the two main ones being TCP and IP. TCP/IP is built into the UNIX operating system and is used by the Internet, making it the de facto standard for transmitting data over networks. Even network operating systems that have their own protocols, such as Netware, also support TCP/IP.</font></dd>
		 
		 <dt><font color="red">    Synchronization:</font> 
		 <dd><dt><font face="Tahoma" color="blue">  
		 Data synchronization technologies are designed to synchronize a single set of data between two or more devices, automatically copying changes back and forth. For example, a user’s contact list on one mobile device can be synchronized with other mobile devices or computers. Data synchronization can be local synchronization where the device and computer are side-by-side and data is transferred or remote synchronization when a user is mobile and the data is synchronized over a mobile network.</font></dd>
		 
		 <dt><font color="red">  RS232:</font> 
		 <dd><dt><font face="Tahoma" color="blue"> 
		  (RS232)Short for recommended standard-232C, a standard interface approved by the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) for connecting serial devices. In 1987, the EIA released a new version of the standard and changed the name to EIA-232-D. And in 1991, the EIA teamed up with Telecommunications Industry association (TIA) and issued a new version of the standard called EIA/TIA-232-E. Many people, however, still refer to the standard as RS-232C, or just RS-232.</font></dd>
		 
		  <dt><font color="red">    ATM:</font> 
		 <dd><dt><font face="Tahoma" color="blue">
	 Short for Asynchronous Transfer Mode, ATM is a type of network technology based on transferring data in cells or packets of a fixed size. The cell used with ATM is relatively small compared to units used with older technologies. The small, constant cell size allows ATM equipment to transmit video, audio, and computer data over the same network, and assure that no single type of data hogs the line.</font></dd>
